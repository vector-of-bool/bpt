Error: Linking a runtime binary failed
######################################

.. highlight:: c++

This error indicates that the final phases of the build pipeline, the link
phases, failed.

The end result of the software development process is to produce applications
and programs that can be executed by users. In the traditional compilation and
linking model, which we still use to this day, multiple *translation units*
(which can be thought of as "source files") are combined together in a process
known as *linking*. The result of linking is an actual executable.

.. note::
    Linking is also used to generate executables that are used as tests.
    Refer: :ref:`pkgs.apps-tests`.


What is "Linking"?
******************

The *phases of translation* define the steps taken by a compiler (and linker)
to map from the input human-readable source code to the code that can be
executed by a machine. The first few phases are collected bundled together in
a phase known as "compilation," while the later phases are known as "linking."

The output of the compilation phases is often generated by a *compiler* and
then written to the filesystem. The resulting files, known as *object files*
are then fed into another tool known as a *linker*.

.. note::
    "Object files" are just one possible intermediate product. Compilers and
    linkers may deal with different intermediate products depending on compiler
    and linker options.


Symbol Reference Resolution
***************************

When code within a translation unit uses a function, variable, or member of a
class that is declared **but not defined** in that translation unit, that
usage is stored as an "unresolved" reference to an external symbol within the
resulting object file.

Each translation unit may also contain the *definitions* of any number of
symbols. It is possible that other translation units may contain unresolved
references to the symbol that the translation unit defines.

It is the job of the linker to fill in these unresolved references when it
combines translation units together.


Failure Modes
*************

There are two very common types of linker errors that may be seen:


Multiple Definitions Found
==========================

When translation units are combined together, the symbols within them are
combined together into a final binary. If two or more translation units contain
the *definition* of a single symbol, then the linker must make a decision:

#. If the symbol is marked properly, then the linker can discard all except one
   of the definitions and choose one to keep in the final binary. For example:
   This is allowed if the associated symbol has been declared with the
   ``inline`` keyword, or is a symbol in any context that is "implicitly
   ``inline``," which includes member functions and static variables which are
   defined within their class's body, and any function template.
#. **Fail**

If the linker is not allowed to discard all-but-one of the multiple
definitions, this is a hard-error. This can happen if multiple translation
units defined the same variable or function at the same namespace.


Issue: A non-``inline`` function is defined in a header file
------------------------------------------------------------

A likely case is that of defining a function in a header file without
marking it as ``inline``:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``hello.hpp``

    #ifndef MY_HEADER_INC
    #define MY_HEADER_INC

    #include <cstdio>

    void say_hello() {
        std::puts("Hello!\n");
    }

    #endif

and then that header is ``#include``-ed in multiple source files:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``a.cpp``

    #include "hello.hpp"

    // ... stuff ...

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``b.cpp``

    #include "hello.hpp"

    // .. different stuff ...

.. note::
    ``template`` functions and member functions *defined within the class body*
    are implicitly ``inline``, and using the ``inline`` keyword is then
    redundant.

In the above configuration, the linker will generate an error about multiple
definitions of the ``say_hello`` function. Possibly confusingly, it will point
to ``a.cpp`` and ``b.cpp`` as the "definers" of ``say_hello``, even though it
is actually defined in the header. The issue is that no tools are currently
able to understand this structure in a way that they can clearly issue
appropriate instruction on how to fix this. There are two ways to fix this:

#. Add the ``inline`` keyword to the definition of ``say_hello``::

        #ifndef MY_HEADER_INC
        #define MY_HEADER_INC

        #include <cstdio>

        inline void say_hello() {
            std::puts("Hello!\n");
        }

        #endif

   This activates the rule that permits the linker to disregard the multiple
   definitions and choose one to keep arbitrarily.

   .. note::
        Only use ``inline`` in headers!

#. Change the definition of ``say_hello`` to be a *declaration*, and move the
   *definition* to a separate source file:

   .. code-block::
        :caption: ``hello.hpp``

        #ifndef MY_HEADER_INC
        #define MY_HEADER_INC

        #include <cstdio>

        void say_hello() {
            std::puts("Hello!\n");
        }

        #endif

   .. code-block::
        :caption: ``hello.cpp``

        #include "hello.hpp"

        void say_hello() {
            std::puts("Hello!\n");
        }

   This will place the sole location of the ``say_hello`` definition within
   ``hello.cpp``.


Issue: There are two colliding and distinct definitions
-------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have two different source files:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``a.cpp``

    #include "a.hpp"

    void error(string message) {
        cerr << "An error occured: " << msg << '\n';
    }

    void a_func() {
        bool had_error = first_a();
        if (err) {
            error(*err);
        }
        err = second_a();
        if (err) {
            error(*err);
        }
    }

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``b.cpp``

    void error(string message) {
        throw runtime_error(msg);
    }

    void b_func() {
        bool had_error = first_b();
        if (had_error) {
            error("The first step failed!");
        }
        had_error = second_b();
        if (had_error) {
            error("The second step failed!");
        }
    }

The two functions, ``a_func`` and ``b_func``, despite having a similar
structure, are *completely different* because of the behavior of ``error``:

- In ``a.cpp``:

    - ``error()`` will simply log a message but let execution continue.
    - If ``first_a()`` fails, execution will continue into ``second_a()``.

- In ``b.cpp``:

    - ``error()`` will throw an exception.
    - If ``first_b()`` fails, execution will never reach ``second_b()``

Nevertheless, the linker will produce an error that there are multiple visible
definitions of ``error()``, even though the translation units individually have
no ambiguity.

The issue is that both of the definitions have *external linkage* and must be
visible to all other translation units.

It may be tempting to fix this issue in the same way that we did in the prior
example: to declare them ``inline``, and it will *seem* to have worked, but
**this will not work correctly!!**

Remember what the linker does in the presence of ``inline`` on multiple
definitions between different translation units: It will *pick one* and
*discard the others*. This means that either ``error`` function may replace the
other across translation units, and the resulting code will have wildly
different behavior.

The *correct* solution is to give the ``error`` function *internal linkage*,
which means that its definition is not visible across translation units. This
will allow both definitions of ``error`` to live together in the linked binary
without ambiguity. The classic way of doing this is through the usage of the
global-scope ``static`` keyword which is present in C::

    static void error(string s) {
        // ...
    }

C++ presents another way it can be done: via an *unnamed namespace*::

    namespace {

    void error(string s) {
        // ...
    }

    }  // close namespace

The benefit of the unnamed namespace is it can be used to mark an entire
section of declarations to be *internal*, and it can also be used to mark a
class definition to have *internal linkage* (There is no way to declare a
"``static class``").


Unresolved External Symbol / Undefined Reference
================================================

Another common error seen while linking is that of the *unresolved external
symbol* (Visual C++) or *undefined reference* (GCC and Clang). Both have the
same underlying cause, and both have the same solutions.

When a translation unit makes use of a symbol which has been declared *but not
defined within that translation unit*, it is up to the linker to resolve that
reference to another translation unit that contains the definition.

If the linker is unable to find the definition of the referenced entity, it
will emit this error.


Issue: An external library is not being included in the link
------------------------------------------------------------

If the unresolved reference is to an entity belonging to an external library,
you may be missing the linker inputs to actually use that library.

If your project makes use of a declared entity from a third party (even if that
usage is transitive through a dependency), it is required that the definitions
from that third party library are included in the link step. This usually comes
in the form of a static library, shared library/DLL, or even plain object
files.

If the external library containing the definition in question is managed by
``dds``, this issue should never occur. If the library exists outside of
``dds`` (e.g. a system library), then that library will need to be manually
added as a linker input using a toolchain file using the ``Link-Flags`` option.
See: :ref:`toolchains.opt-ref`.

If the name of the unresolved symbol appears unfamiliar or you do not believe
that you are making use of it, it is possible that one of your dependencies is
making use of a system library symbol that needs to be part of the link. The
link error will refer to the object/source file that is actually making the
unresolvable reference. Seeing this filepath will be a reliable way to discover
who would be making the reference, and therefore a good way to track down the
dependency that needs an additional linker input. Refer to the documentation
of the dependency in question to see if it requires additional linker inputs
in order to be used.

If the library that should contain the unresolved reference is a dependency
managed by ``dds``, it is possible that the library author has mistakenly
declared a symbol without providing a definition. If the definition *is*
present in the ``dds``-provided dependency library, then the failure to resolve
the reference would be a ``dds`` bug.


Issue: The definition is simply missing
---------------------------------------

C and C++ allow for an entity to be *declared* and *defined* separately. If you
*declare* and entity but do not *define* that entity, your code will work as
long as no one attempts to refer to that entity.

Ensure that the entity that is "missing" exists.


Issue: Missing ``virtual`` method implementations
-------------------------------------------------

If the error refers to a missing ``vtable for class``, or if the error refers
to a missing definition of a ``virtual`` function, it means that one or more
``virtual`` functions are not defined.

Note that ``virtual`` functions are slightly different in this regard: It is
not required that someone actually make a call to the ``virtual`` function for
the definition to be required. The metadata that the compiler generates for
the class containing the ``virtual`` functions will implicitly form a reference
to every ``virtual`` function, so they must all be defined if someone attempts
to instantiate the class, as instantiating the class will form a reference to
that metadata.


Issue: Mismatched declarations and definitions
----------------------------------------------

Suppose you have a header file and a corresponding source file:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``a.hpp``

    namespace foo {

    size_t string_length(const string& str);

    }

.. code-block::
    :caption: ``a.cpp``

    #include "a.hpp"

    using namespace foo;

    size_t string_length(const string& str) {
        // ... implementation goes here ...
    }

The above code will link correctly, as the definition of ``foo::string_length``,
is available from ``a.cpp``, while the declaration exists in ``a.hpp``.

However, if we modify *only the declaration* to use ``string_view`` instead of
``const string&``, something different occurs::

    namespace foo {

    size_t string_length(string_view str);

    }

It may be tempting to say that "our declaration and definition do not match,"
but that is semantically incorrect: We have declared a function
``size_t foo::string_length(string_view)``, but we have defined *and declared*
a **completely different function** ``size_t string_length(const string&)``!
The compiler will not warn about this: There is nothing semantically incorrect
about this code.

The linker, however, will not find any definition of ``foo::string_length``.
The function ``::string_length(const string&)`` isn't even in the ``foo``
``namespace``: It was declared and defined at the global scope within
``a.cpp``.

If you are seeing an error about an unresolved reference to a function that is
declared and defined separately, and you are *sure* is being compiled, check
that the signature (and name) of the definition and declaration match
*exactly*.

.. tip::
    In essence, the error originates from relying on the
    ``using namespace foo`` directive to cause the definition of
    ``string_length`` to incidentally hit the name lookup of the prior
    declaration.

    In C++, using a *qualified name* at the definition site can prevent this
    error from slipping through::

        #include "a.hpp"

        using namespace foo;

        size_t foo::string_length(const string& str) {
            // ... implementation goes here ...
        }

    By using the qualified name ``foo::string_length`` at the definition site,
    the compiler will validate that the function being defined has a prior
    declaration that matches *exactly* to the signature of the definition.

    Note that this *is not* the same as defining the function within a
    ``namespace`` block::

        #include "a.hpp"

        // NOT HELPFUL!

        namespace foo {

        size_t string_length(const string& str) {
            // ... implementation goes here ...
        }

        }

    This will suffer the same potential mistake as defining it with an
    unqualified name.

    Note that within the scope of a function that has been declared within the
    namespace, that namespace is currently within scope even if the definition
    itself is not wrapped in a ``namespace`` block. It may be a good option to
    simply remove the ``using namespace`` directive altogether.

    .. note::
        This trick cannot be applied to names that are declared at the global
        scope, since you cannot use the global-namespace qualifier at a
        function definition (it is not valid syntax)::

            // Declaration at global scope
            void some_function();

            // Definition? No: Invalid syntax!
            void ::some_function() {
                // ... stuff ...
            }


Issue: The source file containing definition is not being included in the link
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the translation unit that contains the definition of an entity is not being
passed to the linker, the linker will not be able to find it!

If you are using ``dds`` correctly, and the compiled source file containing the
definition is placed as a (direct or indirect) descendent of the ``src/``
directory, then ``dds`` will always include that source file as part of the
link for the enclosing library.

Build systems that require you to enumerate your source files explicitly will
not automatically see a source file unless it has been added to the source
list. Even build systems that allow directory-globbing (like CMake) will need
to have the globbing pattern match the path to the source file.
