DDS
######

**dds** is the Drop-Dead-Simple build and library management tool.

dds is a hybrid build system and package manager with a few distinguishing
design decisions that set it apart from current offerings. There's a lot to
learn, but I'm glad you're here! I hope you find ``dds`` useful to you and your
projects.

If you're completely new and have no idea what the project is about, check out
the :doc:`tut/index` page.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    tut/index
    guide/index
    design
    dev/index
    err/index

.. Hide the link to the error reference since we don't want it cluttering our
    main toc, but we want Sphinx to not consider it "unreferenced." We'll generate
    our own link

    For in-depth error and troubleshooting information see: :doc:`err/index`.
