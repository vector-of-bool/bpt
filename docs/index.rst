DDS
######

**dds** is the Drop-Dead-Simple build and library management tool.

dds is a hybrid build system and package manager with a few distinguishing
design decisions that set it apart from current offerings. There's a lot to
learn, but I'm glad you're here! I hope you find ``dds`` useful to you and your
projects.

If you're completely new and have no idea what the project is about, check out
